ok this is how you run this file. first download the file titled poop.sh then follow these steps: 

```
 sudo cd Downloads
```
That just moved you to the Downloads folder
```
sudo chmod +x poop.sh
```
That makes the script executable
```
sudo ./poop.sh
```
That one runs the script. Make backups and be prepared to have to start over. Good luck.
